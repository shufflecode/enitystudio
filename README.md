# entity-studio 

 - a simple .Net class Generator for Database entities based on WinUI3

Supports MySql and MS Sql Server.

### Why ?

Modern Frameworks like enityframework are mighty, but personally I prefer more control over the Database querys. So the code created by *entity studio* is simple and you can add own database querys to increase functionality of your DB classes.

#### Todo: 

Scan for Database Servers in local network
Support for generation settings:
  
  - throw exceptions in attribute getters j/n
  - customize internal variable names.
  - provide interfaces for custom DB implemetations
